# Iris Flower Prediction

## Overview

The Iris Flower Prediction project is a machine learning application that classifies iris flowers into three species based on their measurements. The project uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the Iris dataset, and it provides a RESTful API for making predictions. A React frontend allows users to input flower measurements and receive predictions.

## Features

- **Predict Iris Flower Species**: Classifies iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal dimensions.
- **REST API**: Provides a `POST` endpoint for predictions.
- **Frontend Interface**: A React-based user interface for inputting flower measurements and viewing predictions.
